# Summary
The Layout Editor tool in Android Studio is a visual design editor. You can use the Layout Editor to build your app's layout by dragging UI elements into your layout.
EditText is a UI element that lets the user enter and modify text.
A Button is a UI element that the user can tap to perform an action. A button can consist of text, an icon, or both text and an icon.

## Click listeners

You can make any View respond to being tapped by adding a click listener to it.
The function that defines the click listener receives the View that is clicked.
You can attach a click-listener function to a View in either of two ways:

In the XML layout, add the android:onClick attribute to the <View> element.
Programmatically, use the setOnClickListener(View.OnClickListener) function in the corresponding Activity.
